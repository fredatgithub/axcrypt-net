About Axantum.AxCrypt.iOS

This assembly contains the source code for the AxCrypt iOS application.

NOTE: You must build Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.dll separately for 'Debug' and 'Release' configuration as needed.
      This is built by the AxCrypt.NET solution, which can be loaded simultaneously into MonoDevelop for
      a reasonably convenient workspace environment.
