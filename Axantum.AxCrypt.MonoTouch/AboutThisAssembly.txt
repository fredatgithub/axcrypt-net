About Axantum.AxCrypt.MonoTouch

This assembly is the MonoTouch-specific implementation of the various platform-specific interfaces
defined and used by Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.

Some of the code is identical with the generic Mono implementation, and is thus just linked to
in the project.

Some of the code is specific for MonoTouch and thus have a custom implementation here.

The main application should configure itself for MonoTouch by a line of code similar to:

            OS.Current = new Axantum.AxCrypt.MonoTouch.RuntimeEnvironment();

NOTE: You must build Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.dll separately for 'Debug' and 'Release' configuration as needed.
      This is built by the AxCrypt.NET solution, which can be loaded simultaneously into MonoDevelop for
      a reasonably convenient workspace environment.

FAQ

Q: Why the special handling of Axantum.AxCrypt.Core?

A: There are no really good alternatives. Bringing the code into the solution as a linked project is possible,
   but requires double maintenance. MonoDevelop does not support Configuration-dependent binary references, so
   therefore a Pre-Build event is used to copy the appropriate binary from the Axantum.AxCrypt.Core/bin/Configuration
   directory. Finally, this more closely mirrors the long-term situation where Axantum.AxCrypt.Core really is
   a binary depedency to the full, with it's own release cycle. This is not the case at this time, where it is
   still a somewhat moving target. This is why this way to handle it was chosen. Also, MonoDevelop does not work
   well with XBuild for MonoTouch projects, otherwise a Configuration-dependent conditional dependency manually
   edited in the .csproj might have been a better choice.
