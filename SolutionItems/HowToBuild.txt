About SolutionItems.dll
=======================

The project 'SolutionItems' is a dummy project to bridge the missing feature of a generic MSBuild project
and also to compensate for Visual Studio Express not supporting the 'Solution Items' feature of the
non-Express editions of Visual Studio.

How To Build
============

Windows: Visual Studio 2010 (Any version including Express) or MonoDevelop. Load the solution and hit 'Build'.

Linux: (Tested on Ubuntu) MonoDevelop. If earlier than 2.11, also need 'mono-gmcs' to compile against 3.5 profile.

MonoDevelop: Under "MonoDevelop | Tools | Options | Preferences | Build | General" enable "Compile projects using MSBuild / XBuild".
            (Avoid MonoDevlop issue: "Error while trying to invoke 'al2' to generate satellite assembly for 'XX' culture, File Not Found")

About Configuration and Platforms
=================================

One solution file is used for to build all configurations and platforms.

Supported configurations are:

AppStore         - Mac OS X on the Mac with MonoDevelop. Defined for Axantum.AxCrypt.Core, Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono, Axantum.AxCrypt.Mac
Debug            - Debugging and development. Defined for Axantum.AxCrypt, Axantum.AxCrypt.Core, Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.Test, Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono, Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono.Test
DebugAndroid     - Android debugging and development. Defined for Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.Android
Release          - Distributable. Defined for Axantum.AxCrypt, Axantum.AxCrypt.Core, Axantum.AxCrypt.Mono
ReleaseAndroid   - Distributable. Defined for Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.Android

Target platforms are:

Mixed Platforms  - x86 for Axantum.AxCrypt, and Any CPU for all rest
x86              - Defined for all but Axantum.AxCrypt.Core.Android
Any CPU          - Defined for all

The primary plaform is Any CPU except for Axantum.AxCrypt development where it is x86 due to better edit-and-continue support as well as being the Visual Studio
default, and also except Axantum.AxCrypt.Mac which only supports x86.

Typical combinations used:

Debug|Mixed Platforms   - Development on Windows
Release|Mixed Platforms - Testing release-builds on Windows (not actual production builds)
Release|Any CPU         - Deployable release builds for desktop Mono (Windows, Linux and Mac OS X)
DebugAndroid|Any CPU    - Development for Android
ReleaseAndroid|Any CPU  - Release builds for Android
Debug|x86               - Development for Mac OS X
Release|x86             - Testing release-buidls for Mac OS X
AppStore|x86            - Deployable release builds for Mac OS X

Build combinations from a development scenario:

Mono Desktop on Windows - Debug|Mixed Platforms
Android on Windows      - DebugAndroid|Any CPU
